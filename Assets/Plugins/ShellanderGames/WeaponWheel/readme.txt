Thank you for purchasing this asset! To get started, watch the video tutorial:

Also check out the demo scenes. Note that the InputExtension folder includes most demo scenes.

If you don't use the "new" Input System you can just skip if Unity asks you to install the Input System plugin. Then you delete the folder called "InputExtension" inside the main folder of this package. If you want to install the Unity Input System later you can do so by opening up the Package Manager, select "Packages: Unity Registry" and then look for Input System. As of v1.1, Weapon Wheel Generator also supports the old input system, you'll find the integration inside the "InputLegacy" folder. 

If you need any help, start with the video tutorial found on our Youtube channel, then check out WeaponWheelManual.pdf. If you still have any questions, feedback, want to report an issue or have any feature requests just feel free to contact me anytime. By doing so there will be two winners; you by getting the help you need and me who can improve the asset, including the documentation.
